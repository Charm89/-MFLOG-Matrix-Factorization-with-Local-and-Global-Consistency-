# MFLOG: Matrix Factorization with Local and Global Consistency
## Overview 

The code is an implementation of the method proposed in the paper entitled “A Matrix Factorization Model with Local and Global Consistency for Flow Prediction in Bike-Sharing Systems”. Provided data is a sample from the bike-sharing data used in the experiments. The full data can be found on https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data. To reduce the code execution time for review purposes the applied time span and length of feature vectors (r) are smaller than optimal values in the paper, however, it has not still affected the achieved improvement from the baselines.
